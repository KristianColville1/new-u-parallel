                                <p>It's a simple formula, nurture and take care of people and the returns are massive. All of our people are aligned to who and what matters to U Parallel, they believe and live our mission everyday.</p>

                                <p>We minimise our experiences of mental pain all the time, belittling it or trying to push it away, and the consequence can be devastating.</p>
                                <p>U Parallel's community of professionals is focused on making sure that our minds are taken care of just like our physical health is.</p>
                                <p>By providing therapeutic coaching support and making it accessible at home and work, people will have the opportunity to change the way they relate to their mental health.</p>
